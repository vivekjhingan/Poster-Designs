##  Poster &  Video

As part of this project, I created both the **poster** and the **video** fully from scratch — handling the entire process end-to-end.  

- **Poster** – Designed with original layout, custom color choices, and typography to make the message clear and visually appealing.  
- **Video** – Produced and edited from raw content, adding transitions, text animations, and effects to deliver the concept in a dynamic way.  

This work highlights my ability to combine **design, creativity, and technical editing skills** to build polished visual content starting from a blank canvas.
